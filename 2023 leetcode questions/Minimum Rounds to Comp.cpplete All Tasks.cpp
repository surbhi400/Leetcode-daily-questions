/* You are given a 0-indexed integer array tasks, where tasks[i] represents the difficulty level of a task. In each round, you can complete either 2 or 3 tasks of 
the same difficulty level.

Return the minimum rounds required to complete all the tasks, or -1 if it is not possible to complete all the tasks.

 

Example 1:

Input: tasks = [2,2,3,3,2,4,4,4,4,4]
Output: 4
Explanation: To complete all the tasks, a possible plan is:
- In the first round, you complete 3 tasks of difficulty level 2. 
- In the second round, you complete 2 tasks of difficulty level 3. 
- In the third round, you complete 3 tasks of difficulty level 4. 
- In the fourth round, you complete 2 tasks of difficulty level 4.  
It can be shown that all the tasks cannot be completed in fewer than 4 rounds, so the answer is 4. */

/*  If the frequency is 1, the task cannot be performed so we return -1.
If the frequency is 3, the task can be performed and we return frequency/3.
Now if the frequency is not completely divisible by 3, then the possible remainders are 1 and 2. Lets check them out:
If remainder is 1, i.e, lets take 7 frequency, then 🔮🔮🔮🔮🔮🔮🔮 the groups are something like this "🔮🔮🔮" "🔮🔮🔮" "🔮", i.e, one 🔮 is left alone so the
solution is to break the second last group into two parts of 2 and 1 so that it becomes like: "🔮🔮🔮" "🔮🔮" "🔮🔮", i.e, one is added to the division by 3.
If remainder is 2, i.e, lets take 8 frequency, then 🔮🔮🔮🔮🔮🔮🔮🔮 the groups are something like this "🔮🔮🔮" "🔮🔮🔮" "🔮🔮", i.e, two 🔮 are left so the
solution is to just add 1,i.e, one group of two to the solution. /*
